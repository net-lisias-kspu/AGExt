# Action Groups Extended :: Change Log

* 2014-0607: 1.4 (Diazo) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ Bugfix and stability release.
	+ Error trap VAB/SPH so you can't get stuck with a piece picked up you can't drop.
	+ When the Flight Scene loads with AGX hidden via the toolbar from a previous game session, ActionGroups will now work without having to show and then hide AGX first.
	+ Changes made in flight mode now save correctly. Note that I use the exposed KSP save methods, not my own so if you unexpectedly exit (crash, Alt-F4), you may still lose any recent changes you have made.
	+ Can now select small parts, sort of. Workaround: No change to left click but if you right click a part to show it's menu, that now counts as selecting the part for my mod and will add it to the list.
* 2014-0492: 1.3 (Diazo) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ KSP 23.5 Compatibility. No other changes of note.
* 2014-0401: 1.2.1 (Diazo)
	+ Fix to work with RemoteTech. New users download the file from Spaceport as normal, existing users see this post before updating.
* 2014-0331: 1.2 (Diazo)
	+ Bugfix to symmetry placement. You can now assign actions then go back and multiply the part with symmetry.
	+ Visibility of Flight Window now saved in Flight Scene. At present the only way to hide it is though the Toolbar.
	+ Spelling fix so Linux systems can now use this mod.
* 2014-0330: 1.1 (Diazo)
	+ Hotfix to make the built in Gear/Light/etc. action groups work again. This required removing the compatibility with the default 10 action groups. Action groups in groups Custom 1 through 10 will no longer load when this mod is installed. This will be reinstated in a future release.
	+ Keyset and KeyBinding changes are saved in the AGExt.cfg file. Do not overwrite this file when updating to save your keysets.
* 2014-0330: 1.0 (Diazo)
	+ Initial Release
