## Description

**This mod respects career mode VAB/SPH progress and only shows unlocked action groups by default.**

To override and always have all action groups available, find the `KSP\GameData\Diazo\AGExt\AGExt.cfg` file and change the "OverrideCareer" value to 1 (one) from 0 (zero). You can also use the new stock `ActionGroupsAlwaysAvailable` option in-game, found under `Custom Difficutly -> Advanced Options`.

- Option to override Career Mode action groups lockout on low level buildings to use action groups immediately if desired (Disabled by default)
- Increase the number of action groups to 250
- Edit Actions in Flight.
- Name Action Groups on a per vessel basis, so you can remember what is assigned where
- Actions state can be color coded based on status. (Note this defaults to off.)
- Toggle monitoring allows visual feedback of actions that lack this, such as the "Inverted Steering" on a wheel.
- Supports saving actions to sub-assemblies
