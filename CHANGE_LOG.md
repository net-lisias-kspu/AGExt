# Action Groups Extended :: Change Log

* 2014-0331: 1.2 (Diazo)
	+ Bugfix to symmetry placement. You can now assign actions then go back and multiply the part with symmetry.
	+ Visibility of Flight Window now saved in Flight Scene. At present the only way to hide it is though the Toolbar.
	+ Spelling fix so Linux systems can now use this mod.
* 2014-0330: 1.1 (Diazo)
	+ Hotfix to make the built in Gear/Light/etc. action groups work again. This required removing the compatibility with the default 10 action groups. Action groups in groups Custom 1 through 10 will no longer load when this mod is installed. This will be reinstated in a future release.
	+ Keyset and KeyBinding changes are saved in the AGExt.cfg file. Do not overwrite this file when updating to save your keysets.
* 2014-0330: 1.0 (Diazo)
	+ Initial Release
